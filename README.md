# Hey there, I'm Muhammad Ilham! 👋

Living in the beautiful town of Jimbaran, Bali, I'm your go-to guy for **web development** and **digital marketing**. Though my journey began in Surabaya, I found a new home here in Bali in August 2019. Since then, I've been a Digital Marketing Consultant for a top-tier Wedding Organizer company, and now I'm diving deep into programming as a Frontend Engineer at an exciting startup in Denver, USA. 

When I'm not coding, you'll find me helping out friends with their websites or crafting digital marketing strategies.

## Coffee Chat Topics ☕️

Who doesn't love a good chat over coffee and some light bites? Here are some of the topics I could talk about for hours:

- **Programming**: I love discussing everything from Javascript and Typescript to Next JS, React, and React Native.
- **Web Development**: I'm a pro at HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, and Wordpress.
- **Web Design & Performance**: From conceptualizing to boosting website performance, I'm all about it.
- **Digital Marketing**: Social Media marketing, funneling, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) - I've got you covered.
