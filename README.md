# Hi there! I'm Muhammad Ilham! 👋

## About Me 🚀

Hello from the beautiful Jimbaran, Bali! Originally from Surabaya, my journey led me here in August 2019 and I haven't looked back since. I've been a Digital Marketing Consultant for a leading Wedding Organizer company, and guess what? I loved every bit of it! 

But you know what I love even more? **Web development** and **digital marketing**! That's why I'm thrilled to share that I'm now serving as a Frontend Engineer at [Fetchly Labs](https://www.fetch.ly), an innovative startup based in Denver, USA. At Fetchly, we're passionate about using data to drive actions, helping businesses connect with customers like never before!

I'm proud to say that I've built over 10 website projects, led and consulted a startup company, and even developed a few personal-use WordPress plugins. Each day brings new challenges and opportunities to learn, which is just the way I like it.

## On a Personal Note 😄

When I'm not elbow-deep in code, I love learning new programming languages, diving into a new anime series, or just chilling with family and friends at coffee shops, beaches, or malls. Life is all about balance, right?

## Future Goals 🎯

Looking ahead, my ambition is to build web and mobile apps that can be game-changers for small businesses. There's so much potential out there, and I can't wait to explore it.

## Coffee Chat Topics ☕️

Speaking of coffee, I absolutely love deep-diving into conversations about:

- **Programming**: From Javascript and Typescript to Next JS, React, and React Native – let's talk!
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, and Wordpress? Count me in!
- **Web Design & Performance**: I'm all about creating and fine-tuning until it's just right.
- **Digital Marketing**: Social Media marketing, funneling, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) - I've got loads to share!

## Let's Connect! 🤝
