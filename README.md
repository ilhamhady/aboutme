# Hey there, I'm Muhammad Ilham! 👋

## A little bit about me 🌎

Hello from the beautiful Jimbaran, Bali! Originally from Surabaya, my journey led me here in August 2019 and I haven't looked back since. I've been a Digital Marketing Consultant for a leading Wedding Organizer company, and guess what? I loved every bit of it! 

But you know what I love even more? **Web development** and **digital marketing**! That's why I'm thrilled to share that I'm now serving as a Frontend Engineer at [Fetchly Labs](https://www.fetch.ly), an innovative startup based in Denver, USA. At Fetchly, we're passionate about using data to drive actions, helping businesses connect with customers like never before!

When I'm not elbow-deep in code or working out a digital marketing strategy, you'll probably catch me helping friends with their websites or sharing a laugh over a cup of coffee.

## Let's Chat Over Coffee ☕️

Speaking of coffee, I absolutely love deep-diving into conversations about:

- **Programming**: From Javascript and Typescript to Next JS, React, and React Native – let's talk!
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, and Wordpress? Count me in!
- **Web Design & Performance**: I'm all about creating and fine-tuning until it's just right.
- **Digital Marketing**: Social Media marketing, funneling, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) - I've got loads to share!
